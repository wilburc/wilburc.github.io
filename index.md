# Hello

<img src='/files/IMG_2154.png' data-action='zoom' />

## I’m Wilbur
—yeah, like the pig. Or the airplane guy. I love design, data, and everything in between.  Hobbies include discussing use of the word “hella,” making guacamole, and watching trashy reality TV.

## What I do & why
I do what I do to help people—to create things they *want*. Noticing the dire lack of user-friendly tools in the workplace and other settings, I set out to create experiences that boost productivity, create value, and maybe inspire a bit of joy. Previous experiences include building internal tools for engineers at [Broadcom][1], designing applications for soldiers at [Metronome Software][2], and making all sorts of fun things at [U.C. Irvine.][3]

While originally from the Bay Area, I’m currently braving my first winter in Chicago, where I work with the wrangling, analysis, and visualization of data within the Data Science team at [Centro][4].

See you around,<br><i>-Wilbur</i>
